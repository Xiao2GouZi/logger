import * as fs from 'fs';

Cannot find module 'fs' or its corresponding type declarations.

I have already tried to use npm install  @types/node --save-dev and add in to the file tsconfig.json inside compilerOptions "types": ["node"],"typeRoots": ["node_modules/@types"], So, if someone can give me an help to troubleshooting this error or give me a different solution I will be glad.
